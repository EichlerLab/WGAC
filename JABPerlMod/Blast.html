<P>
A call to this subroutine parses a query and returns a hash containing all
of the parsed data. Here is a short bit of code to get you started. Pass a
filehandle glob and set any need values or filters. Just a few of the
possible filters are used in this example

<P>
<PRE> use lib '/JABPerlMod';    # directory where Blast.pm is stored
 use Blast qw(&amp;parse_query); 
 while ( !eof(IN) ) {
    my %q = %{ &amp;parse_query( FILEHANDLE =&gt; \*IN, 
         SKIP_SUBJECTS=&gt; \%prev_queries,
         MIN_BPALIGN =&gt; 50, SKIP_OVERLAP=&gt; $true, 
         SKIP_SELF =&gt; $false, SKIP_IDENT_HSP=&gt; $true) };
    next if $q{'error'} eq 'No Blast Title Found';
    print Dumper \%q;   #use datadumper for good view of data                                           
    $prev_queries{$q{'qname'}}=1;

<P>
<CODE>&amp;parse_query</CODE> is a subroutine that parses pairwise
blastoutput. It has many options, but most importantly all data of interest
can be parsed (including alignments). The subroutine parses one query at a
time, and will return all subjects and their high scoring pairs (hsp). This
program has beenn used extensively for nucleotide comparisons, and has yet
to be used for protein. Additionally, it has only been used on NCBI
standalone blastall pairwise output. The parsing model was based
extensively on Ian Korf's BPlite, which handles protein and WU-BLAST, so
<CODE>&amp;parse_query</CODE> should be able to parse protein and WU-BLAST.
BPlite is object oriented which I find slightly cumbersome for quick
manipulations, but may be more useful to you than a hash structure you
don't understand.

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="HASH_STRUCTURE_AND_CONTENT">HASH STRUCTURE AND CONTENT</A></H2>
<P>
For each call to the subroutine, a query parsed and the parsed output is
returned in the form of a pointer to a hash. The structure of this hash is
outlined below All values are standarded except for a few calculated (or
value added blast) parameters denoted by ***

<P>
<PRE> 
 {'&lt;program&gt;'}      blast program and version, e.g. BLASTN 2.0.7
 {'db'}{'name'}   name of database
 {'db'}{'seq#'}   number of sequences in database
 {'db'}{'len'}    length in bases of the database
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE> {'qname'}     really just the first non-space characters in title ***
                  NAME_TYPE =&gt; 'VERSION' then |VERSION| is sought
 {'qlen'}      length of query
 {'qdefn'}     definition line without name if name at beginning
 
 {'sbjct'}[0]  an array containing all the subject hashes
    {'name'}      name of subject (VERSION option applies) ***
    {'defn'}      defnition line without name if name at beginning
    {'len'}       length of subject sequence
    {'hsps'}      an array containing all of the hsp hashes
       {'bits'}       bit score for largest hsp
       {'score'}      ??? score for largest hsp
       {'expect'}     expected value based on length of query and database
       {'bpident'}    number of bases/residues identical
       {'%ident'}     % of bases/residues (bpident/sizealign)
       {'bppos'}      number of similar residues 
       {'%pos'}       % of similar residues (bppos/sizealign)
       {'bpgap'}      number of gapped bases
       {'%gap'}       % of gaps (bpgap/sizealign)
       {'sizealign'}  alignment size (bases + gaps)
       {'qb'}         beginning alignment position of query
       {'qe'}         ending alignment position of query
       {'sb'}         beginning alignment position of subject 
       {'se'}         ending alignment position of subject
       {'bpalign'}    number of bases juxtaposed (sizealign - gaps) ***
       {'alignq'}     query string of alignment (only if ALIGN =&gt; 1)
       {'alignm'}     middle matching |||||| |||| (only if ALIGN =&gt; 1)
       {'aligns'}     subject string of alignment (only if ALIGN =&gt; 1)
</PRE>
<P>
NOTE:A blast subject can be made of multiple hsps; however, gap blast only
provides statistics on the highest highest scoring pair.

<H2><A NAME="PARSE_OPTIONS">PARSE OPTIONS</A></H2>
<P>
NAME_TYPE =&gt;('')/'VERSION' 'VERSION' will parse version for name

<P>
ALIGN =&gt; (0)/1 set to 1 will return alignment strings for hsps

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="FILTER_OPTIONS">FILTER OPTIONS</A></H2>
<P>
There are going to be a lot of names that should have been deprecated
before I started programming the filters but I haven't invested the effort
to add more meaningful names yet. Below are both current and planned (***)
FILTERS=&gt;(with default values).

 MIN_BPIDENT   (0)     MIN_%IDENT      (0)***    MAX_%IDENT      (101)*** 
 MIN_BPPOS     (0)***  MIN_%POS        (0)***    MAX_%POS        (101) ***

<H3><A NAME="FILTERS_based_on_other_hsps">FILTERS based on other hsps</A></H3>
<P>
SKIP_OVERLAP (0)/1 if 1 all <STRONG>double</STRONG> overlaps will be removed. Double overlaps are overlaps where both the 2
hsps' queries overlap and the subjects overlap. All hsps are compared to
higher scoring ones. If a lower scoring one overlaps it is deleted, and
thus only the higher scoring ones are keptedthe 2 hsps' queri

<P>
SKIP_ALLOVERLAP_ORIENT =&gt; (0)/1 if set to 1 all overlapping and
misoriented (relative to highest hsp) are removed. Should be left with
non-touching hsps with the same subject orientation. 

<P>
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="FILTERS_for_various_higher_level">FILTERS for various higher level query or subject interactions</A></H3>
<P>
SKIP_SELF (0)/1 if set to 1 then all hits that have the same name for query
and subject will be deleted. Usually a record that hits itself is
uninteresting.

<P>
SKIP_IDENT_HSP (0)/1 if set to 1 then all hits that have the same name for
query and subject and the same begins and ends for the alignment are
deleted. This removes a sequence hitting itself, but allows for the
seuquence to hit itself in a different location

<P>
SKIP_SUBJECTS =&gt; \%HASH A hash that contains subjects to skip. For
instance, hash contents of (AC00003=&gt;1,AC00004=&gt;1) would skip these
to accession numbers if they appeared as a subject of a blast hit. The
value must be set to 1. This filter is useful for removing duplicate
pairwise comparisons (A hits B and B hits A) when blasting a database
against itself.
